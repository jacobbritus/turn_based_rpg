# So if files are still showing on GitHub but you want to ignore them:
  #Add the files or patterns to .gitignore (youâ€™ve done this).
  #
  #Remove the files from git tracking but keep them locally by running:
  #
  #bash
  #Copy code
  #git rm --cached filename
  #or for multiple files/patterns:
  #
  #bash
  #Copy code
  #git rm -r --cached foldername
  #Commit the changes:
  #
  #bash
  #Copy code
  #git commit -m "Remove ignored files from tracking"
  #Push to GitHub:
  #
  #bash
  #Copy code
  #git push origin main  # or master, depending on your branch
